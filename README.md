### Budget App - Certification Project # 3
- file name: Budget_App_Project.py
- In this project the students are tasked to create a budgeting application that allows users to manage their finances across different spending categories.
- The `Category` class provides methods for depositing funds, making withdrawals, checking balances, and transferring money between categories while ensuring funds are available before transactions occur.
- Additionally, the `create_spend_chart` function generates a visual representation of spending habits across categories, displaying a percentage-based breakdown of expenditures.
- The code is designed with structured logic, ensuring accurate financial tracking and intuitive output formatting.
- This project is useful for those looking to understand Python object-oriented programming while building practical financial management tools.
